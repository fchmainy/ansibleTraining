What is Ansible?
===============
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

Being designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.

It uses **no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure**, so it is  easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a **very simple language** (**YAML**, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

or as a short answer:

**a simple automation tool without any agent to install on targets to run a succession of configuration tasks using a simple human readable language**
